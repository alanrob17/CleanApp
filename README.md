# Clean application

This is a simple console application that remove certain characters from a file name. It removes diacritics, emojis and other unwanted characters. I mainly use this to clean music files.

## Usage

```bash
    clean
```

Once the file is cleaned a report is created detailing all changes to files.

Example result.

> C:\Temp\test\01 - Beethoven- Bagatelle No. 25 in A Minor, 'FÃ¼r Elise', WoO 59.flac        
> to        
> C:\Temp\test\01 - Beethoven- Bagatelle No. 25 in A Minor, 'Fur Elise', WoO 59.flac
